## Earnings
* Didn't do any market research, didn't A/B test etc, just went with gut on what felt right and been happy with the results
* totals
* Surprised continues to earn
* Tip jar wasn't worth it

## Learnings
* Decided not to localise - money on the table but would take it from being a fun side project to being hard work and slowed me down
* So much work goes into releasing an app. Not just coding it, building a website, handling support, marketing, designing screenshots and app icons. Structuring a project, scheduling releases. Haven't done any of these in a professional environment with people who know what they're doing so I'm fumbling my way through it.
* Haven't got the hang of compartmentalising smaller updates on different branches to larger feature updates - art to it. Git management as much as anything
* Pushing things into places that maybe they hadn't been designed to go - most apps wouldn't have 130+ siri intents. Binary scan rejected app for intent count. Hit bugs that probably wouldn't affect 99.9% of apps - Shortcuts team have been incredibly helpful and responsive to fixing these types of issues

## What's Next For TBP?
* latest update in the new year once 14.4 is released
* changed structure so I can add more examples more easily
* always taking suggestions for new tools
* look at new frameworks 
* threw a lot of dirt at the wall, now looking at taking popular features and expanding them logically - menu box and potentially Preview
