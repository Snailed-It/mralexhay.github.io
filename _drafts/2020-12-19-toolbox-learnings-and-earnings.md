summary:  A quick look at some of the numbers 12 months on from releasing my first app.
---


It's been just over a year since I released my first app, [Toolbox Pro](https://www.toolboxpro.app).

I've always found it interesting to read break-downs by developers that lift the curtain on their indie apps, so I thought I'd write up some of the stats for Toolbox Pro and some observations I've made along the way. 

Here are the TL;DR numbers (after 13 months):

* üìà 104k downloads
* üí∞ ~¬£63k revenue (in-app purchase & tip jar)
* üí∑ ~¬£41k take-home (after Apple's cut)
* üîì ~10% of downloaders paid to unlock premium
* ‚≠êÔ∏è 4.6 average rating
* üìù 153 reviews

## Starting Out With SwiftUI
I hadn't written any code before June last year other than some noodling around with AppleScript on my Mac and JavaScript in [Scriptable](https://scriptable.app). 

Professionally, I'm a freelance [documentary editor](https://www.alexhay.tv), that's what I'm usually doing day to day, but I've always been a Mac nerd and interested in how apps are made.

I downloaded Xcode a few years back and tried to get my head around it but it's pretty overwhelming for someone starting from scratch. Delegates, singletons, view controllers, auto-layout and storyboards are pretty unintuitive and impenetrable to the uninitiated and I lost interest fairly quickly.

When Apple announced SwiftUI at WWDC 2019 and gave a slick on-stage demo of a WYSIWIG .

## Earnings
* Didn't do any market research, didn't A/B test etc, just went with gut on what felt right and been happy with the results
* totals
* Surprised continues to earn
* Tip jar wasn't worth it

## Learnings
* Decided not to localise - money on the table but would take it from being a fun side project to being hard work and slowed me down
* So much work goes into releasing an app. Not just coding it, building a website, handling support, marketing, designing screenshots and app icons. Structuring a project, scheduling releases. Haven't done any of these in a professional environment with people who know what they're doing so I'm fumbling my way through it.
* Haven't got the hang of compartmentalising smaller updates on different branches to larger feature updates - art to it. Git management as much as anything
* Pushing things into places that maybe they hadn't been designed to go - most apps wouldn't have 130+ siri intents. Binary scan rejected app for intent count. Hit bugs that probably wouldn't affect 99.9% of apps - Shortcuts team have been incredibly helpful and responsive to fixing these types of issues

## What's Next For TBP?
* latest update in the new year once 14.4 is released
* changed structure so I can add more examples more easily
* always taking suggestions for new tools
* look at new frameworks 
* threw a lot of dirt at the wall, now looking at taking popular features and expanding them logically - menu box and potentially Preview
