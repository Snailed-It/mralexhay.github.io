## Getting Started With Xcode
I hadn't written any code before June last year other than some noodling around with AppleScript on my Mac and JavaScript in [Scriptable](https://scriptable.app). 

Professionally, I'm a freelance [documentary editor](https://www.alexhay.tv), that's what I'm usually doing day to day, but I've always been a Mac nerd and interested in how apps are made.

I downloaded Xcode a few years back and tried to get my head around it but it was pretty overwhelming for someone starting from scratch: delegates, singletons, view controllers, auto-layout and storyboards are pretty unintuitive and impenetrable to the uninitiated and I lost interest fairly quickly.

When I watched Craig Federighi [announce](https://youtu.be/psL_5RIBqnY?t=7598) Apple's new declarative UI framework, SwiftUI, at WWDC 2019, it was described as
